"""
Pseudocode:
1. Start
2. Define a function to calculate total cost based on the number of items:
    a. Prompt user to enter the number of items they want to purchase.
    b. Determine the cost per item based on the following quantity discounts:
        - If number of items is between 1 and 19, cost per item is $4.75
        - If number of items is between 20 and 49, cost per item is $4.50
        - If number of items is between 50 and 99, cost per item is $4.25
        - If number of items is 100 or more, cost per item is $4.00
    c. Calculate the total cost as number of items multiplied by cost per item.
    d. Return the number of items, cost per item, and total cost.
3. Define a main function to control the program flow:
    a. Enter a loop that does the following until the user decides to stop:
        i. Call the function to calculate total cost and display results.
        ii. Display the cost per item and the total cost.
        iii. Prompt the user to decide if they wish to run the program again.
        iv. If user inputs 'No', thank them and break the loop to end the program.
4. Check if the script is the main program and if so, call the main function to execute.
5. End
