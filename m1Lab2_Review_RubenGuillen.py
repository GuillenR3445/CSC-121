"""
Pseudocode:
1. Start
2. Define a function to determine the fastest route based on user input:
    a. Initialize variables to track the fastest route and fastest time.
    b. Set a control variable to 'y' to start the loop.
3. Enter a loop that runs as long as the control variable is 'y':
    a. Prompt the user to enter the distance of the route in miles.
    b. Validate that the distance is greater than 0. If not, prompt again.
    c. Prompt the user to enter the speed for the route in miles per hour.
    d. Validate that the speed is greater than 0. If not, prompt again.
    e. Calculate the time for the route in minutes using the formula (distance / speed) * 60.
    f. Display the calculated time for the current route.
    g. Check if the current route time is the fastest. If so, update the fastest route and fastest time.
    h. Prompt the user to decide if they wish to enter more routes.
    i. Validate the user's input for continuation ('y' for yes, 'n' for no). If invalid, prompt again.
    j. If the user inputs 'y', increment the route number and continue the loop.
    k. If the user inputs 'n', exit the loop.
4. After exiting the loop, display the fastest route and the corresponding time.
5. End
